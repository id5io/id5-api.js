## ðŸš€ Features
-  treat GPP consent objects without any consent flags as invalid and send to server for verification

    Some CMPs are unfortunately returning invalid parsed Consent objects - they are missing any consent flags, even if those flags are in the consent string. 
    We now treat such consent objects as invalid and fallback to the server side to actually parse the consent string and check those flags.
